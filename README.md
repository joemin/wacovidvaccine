# WA COVID Vaccines

## Application Summary
This application was made to help ease access to finding COVID-19 vaccine availability in Washington state. I have a lot of family and loved ones that live there, so I figured I had to at least give this a shot to make it easier for them!
This application currently supports finding availability from the following list of types of providers:
- Costco

## Overall Architecture
Everything is in Docker containers for ease of distribution and usability. Dependencies are baked in!
### Backend
Python-based backend that uses Selenium to first scrape the WA state DOH site for testing locations. This gets output as a JSON file to `backend/results/locations.json`  
Then, based on location type, it uses modular scrapers to pull availability information from each location. This, too, gets output as a JSON file: `backend/results/availability.json`  
In production, these files are generated by running this backend code in an AWS Lambda job, and they then get pushed to an S3 bucket for the frontend to consume.  
### Frontend
Pretty standard React frontend. To be implemented.
